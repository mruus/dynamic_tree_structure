# Tree Building Project

This project demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a tree-like structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). The tree represents a hierarchical view, and the user can search, expand, collapse, and navigate through its nodes.

## Preview the Project

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser
- Internet connection (for external dependencies)

### How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Explore the tree structure.
3. Use the provided actions to search, expand, collapse, and navigate through nodes.
4. Additional functionality is available, such as keyboard shortcuts for search and navigation.

## Project Structure

- **HTML (`index.html`):** Defines the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS (`style.css`):** Provides styling for the webpage.
- **JavaScript (`tree.js`):** Contains the logic for rendering and manipulating the tree structure using jQuery.

## Dependencies

- Bootstrap 5.3.2: Used for styling and layout.
- Boxicons 2.1.4: Provides icons used in the project.

## Tree Data

The tree structure is generated dynamically and can be easily modified by updating the `treeData` array in the `tree.js` file.

## Functionality

- **Search:** Users can search for specific nodes in the tree.
- **Expand/Collapse:** Nodes with children can be expanded or collapsed.
- **Navigation:** Users can navigate through search results using keyboard shortcuts.
